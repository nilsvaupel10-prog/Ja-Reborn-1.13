# Changelog

All notable changes to this Android port are documented here.

This project follows the spirit of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Synchronized JA2 Stracciatella upstream changes through `a3bd56e`, including optional stat healing through doctoring and externalized suppression settings.
- Mod support in the Android launcher: mods in `.ja2/mods` and the mods bundled in the APK assets are discovered, can be enabled, disabled and reordered in a new `Manage Mods` dialog, and are stored in the `mods` array of `ja2.json`.
- `ja2.json` is now read and written through `Ja2ConfigRepository`, which keeps keys the launcher has no UI for, tolerates comments and trailing commas, backs up unreadable files, and writes atomically.

### Changed

- Updated native savegame serialization to version `103` for persisted stat-damage fields. The Android app version remains unchanged pending release approval.

### Fixed

- Adopted upstream fixes for closing the Map Screen keyring popup during shutdown and rendering down arrows at the correct tactical coordinates.
- Updated the Rust C API configuration test to match the current `NEAR_PERFECT` scaling default.

### Verified

- Ran Rust `cargo test`.
- Ran `:app:testDebugUnitTest`.
- Ran `:app:externalNativeBuildDebug`.
- Built `:app:assembleRelease --rerun-tasks`.

## 2026-06-24 - 1.0.5

### Added

- Added an opt-in Android auto-update checker for GitHub Releases
  (`RealTommyGreen/JA2-Reborn`) with release lookup, APK download, verification,
  and explicit install confirmation.
- Added a manual update check button to the launcher header, left of the language
  flags, with update-available, up-to-date, progress, and error feedback.
- Added a CTRL Examine touch-overlay toggle for tactical interactions that need a held CTRL modifier.
- Added a one-time start notice that tells users the new Examine touch-overlay button can be added from the new-button menu.
- Added a Map Screen touch input mode setting with Direct Touch, Touchpad Mouse, and combined input modes.

### Changed

- Added Android manifest permissions and FileProvider configuration required for
  network update checks and downloaded APK handoff.
- Added persisted update preferences for opt-in state, rate limiting, and known
  update version tracking.
- The launcher now offers the update opt-in flow on startup and handles update
  dialogs, release notes, progress, installation handoff, and lifecycle-safe UI updates.

### Fixed

- Fixed update installation failure paths so install-permission round trips and
  interrupted installer launches report errors instead of failing silently.
- Fixed the touch-overlay Stealth toggle showing a stale active state after switching to another selected merc.
- Fixed sticky Item Stacking and Sidestep/Backstep modifier toggles blocking later touch actions, while keeping Item Stacking active across tactical inventory-area and Map Screen touches.
- Fixed Map Screen touch input mode slider label alignment.
- Fixed German touch preset labels for CTRL Examine and SHIFT Item Stacking.
- Fixed the forced touch-layout reset so only pre-1.0.4 configs are reset. Users already on 1.0.4 or newer, and fresh installs, no longer see the reset warning unnecessarily.

### Verified

- Ran `:app:testDebugUnitTest`.
- Ran focused touch-overlay migration tests for the 1.0.3-to-1.0.4 reset threshold.
- Built and verified the signed release APK with versionCode `1000005`.
- Verified APK asset matching, SHA-256 digest checks, version-code checks, and
  signature matching in the update flow.
- Verified the 1.0.5 touch fixes on Android hardware.

## 2026-06-19 - 1.0.4

### Added

- Added a full SVG touch-overlay icon pipeline with 37 bundled icons, `iconset.json`, `iconmappings.json`, per-button icon sizing, and transform metadata.
- Added a separate editable Map Screen touch-overlay layout with its own presets and default buttons.
- Added mouse buttons to the Map Screen default layout, positioned like the tactical mouse buttons.
- Added sticky toggle-key support for modifier buttons, including visible active-state feedback.
- Added a Hardware mouse/keyboard input mode for direct physical input passthrough.
- Added a Reload Selected touch preset (`ALT+R`) with a dedicated reload icon.
- Added configurable Direct Tap Arbitration timing in touch settings.
- Added a one-time touch-layout reset notice after the forced 1.0.4 default-preset refresh.

### Changed

- Replaced the bundled touch-overlay default preset and force-refreshes older user layouts once for this default-preset version.
- Bumped the touch-overlay config schema to 15 and separated default-preset versioning from schema migrations.
- Reworked icon rendering so SVG icons render first and Canvas drawing is only a fallback.
- Reworked the Map Screen overlay defaults from legacy keyboard-style buttons to a compact SVG-backed layout.
- Renamed and localized several touch presets for clearer in-game editing.
- Rebuilt the touch-overlay lock button as an SVG-backed rounded square.
- Ordered Hardware mouse/keyboard mode directly below Modern Controls in the launcher dropdown.
- Kept the touch overlay visible in Shopkeeper/Vendor screens, using the regular tactical button layout.
- Improved widescreen placement for Auto-Bandage, Shopkeeper/Vendor UI, tactical NPC dialogue, subtitle text, civilian quotes, and tutorial panels.
- Excluded the D-pad from shape-aware hit-testing so its full touch area remains usable.
- Reworked the public project documentation.
- Moved Android build instructions into `docs/BUILDING_ANDROID.md`.
- Added the Android scaling plan to the public documentation and linked it from the README and Android feature overview.
- Added public release documentation, release notes, third-party notices, and a repository sanity workflow.
- Clarified that clean release builds produce `app-release-unsigned.apk` unless signing is configured locally.

### Fixed

- Fixed Map Screen buttons not appearing after update because migration only filled empty `mapScreenButtons` on schema bump.
- Fixed Map Screen Inventory toggling item highlight (key I) instead of opening the inventory panel (key ENTER).
- Fixed SVG icon alignment by correctly converting IconConverter offsets into Android Canvas coordinates.
- Fixed the touch-overlay lock button being too small and hard to see.
- Fixed legacy strafe presets triggering grab behavior by replacing them with the `alt_movement_hold` toggle preset.
- Fixed sticky-toggle key release so forced releases send KeyUp without toggling state again.
- Fixed sector exit dialog using incorrect dirty-rect coordinates (width/height instead of right/bottom).
- Fixed the touch-overlay editor showing tactical presets in the Map Screen and Map Screen presets in tactical screens.
- Fixed hardware mouse mode appearing at the wrong dropdown position.
- Fixed Auto-Bandage causing a temporary 4:3 layout jump on widescreen displays.
- Fixed Shopkeeper/Vendor menus being cropped or mis-scaled on wide displays.
- Fixed the touch-layout reset notice being cropped when shown in the main menu.
- Fixed direct-tap false positives after cursor movement in touchpad mode.
- Fixed shape-unaware hit-testing registering false touches in invisible button corners.
- Fixed D-pad corners becoming unresponsive after shape-aware hit-testing was introduced.

### Verified

- Ran `:app:testDebugUnitTest`.
- Ran `:app:externalNativeBuildDebug`.
- Built `:app:assembleDebug`.
- Installed the debug APK successfully on Android hardware with `adb install -r`.

## 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Fixed tactical name labels leaving white trails while scrolling the map during merc movement.

## 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added the Android-native modular touch overlay system with persistent JSON configuration.
- Added configurable overlay buttons for mouse, keyboard, key combos, text, D-pad movement, sector exits, interface actions, and cheat actions.
